# Using genetic algorithms for tuning autoencoders architecture

Generative models are gaining more and more interest as their application expands. However creating these models is not as simple as it may seem, as advanced understanding of models workflow, clean training data and good architecture are minimum requirements to achieve acceptable performance.
In this work we will try to overcome one of these challenges by using genetic algorithms for architecture tuning.
