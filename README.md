# Using genetic algorithms for tuning autoencoders architecture

[Autoencoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder) are gaining 
more and more interest as their application expands. 
However, creating these models is not as simple 
as it may seem, as advanced understanding of models workflow, 
clean training data and good architecture are minimum requirements 
to achieve acceptable performance. 
We overcame one of these challenges by using 
[genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) 
for architecture tuning. As a result, we achieved a pipeline to improve
architecture on [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
cat generation.
